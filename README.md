# Algorithms and Data Structures

One of my personal favorite things: compact logical challenges solved with code!

This repo contains some algorithms and data structure models that I've written/solved as part of strengthening my grasp of CS theory.

Additionally, I've included an enormous [curated list of algorithms](/algorithms.md) in this repo.
